Welcome to this example wiki. In here there are guides on how to set up a project using MkDocs, git-prehooks, CI/CD, Docker, issue tracking and other means to make the greenhouse process more streamlined. The integration of documentation follows a light version of [docs-as-code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/), such as version control, markdown, code reviews and automated tests are followed. We advice reading through just the first page to get comfortable with the philosphy.

Everything done here is just an example and one may use the template, or alter things if you deem neccecary.
