GitHub Project Boards are a powerful project management feature that helps teams organize, prioritize, and track their work directly within GitHub. These boards provide a visual way to manage GitHub issues and pull requests, making it easier for teams to collaborate and stay organized. 

## Project board beta
As of writing this (02/11/23), GitHub as revamped project board to exclude workflows, today they are working with templates which is in beta. So this guide can be changed in the future.

## Project board template
In the repos project board, there is a  template named `project template knowit`. This template can be applied to any project to follow the [kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) board methodology. The board can of course be re-configured. 

## Link project template to a project
To link a project board to a specific project, you need to access the settings by clicking on the 3 dots icon at the righthand corner. Then in the settings, you need to connect the template to the existing repo and name it. Then the issue and project board is connected and will dynamically change whenever one is altered.
