Webhooks can generally be used to integrate third-party tools with GitHub. This is a guide on how to use webhooks to set up automatic notifications, for example for Teams. 

To enable automated notifications using webhooks on GitHub, you can set up a webhook to be notified of events that occur in a repository. This can be useful for integrating your GitHub repository with other applications or services. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up a webhook for automated notifications on GitHub:

Log in to your GitHub account: Go to the GitHub website and log in using your credentials.

Access Repository Settings: Navigate to the repository for which you want to set up the webhook.

Access Webhooks Settings: In the repository, click on the "Settings" tab, then select "Webhooks" from the left sidebar.

Add a New Webhook: Click on the "Add webhook" button to create a new webhook for the repository.

Configure Webhook Settings:

Enter the Payload URL: This is the URL where you want to receive the webhook payloads.
Choose the Content type.
Select which events you want the webhook to trigger for.
Set the "Active" option to receive the notifications.
Set up Secret (optional): You can set up a secret to secure your webhook payloads. This step is optional but recommended for security.

Add the Webhook: Click on the "Add webhook" button to save the webhook settings.

Test the Webhook: GitHub provides a way to test your webhook to ensure that it's configured correctly and receiving payloads.
