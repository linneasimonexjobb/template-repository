# CI/CD Template

This is a template repo on how you may set up a working project within greenhouse. There are guides within the files how to set up the files but no code is provided. 

## Getting started
In the .github folder you will find the folder workflows and the files ISSUE_TEMPLATE and PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE

### TEMPLATES
The both templates generates a markdown file when a... issue or pull request is created. The files needs to be specified within the folder and with the characteristcs. If needed, you may alter the templates in your own repo.


### Workflows
The workflows specify how the CI/CD will run when changes to the code has been pushed. There are four yml files as a starter but may need to alter, remove or add another to fit your project. More info in the docs.
